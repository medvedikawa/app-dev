## Stalker (–°—Ç–∞–ª–∫–µ—Ä)
## Release: May 25, 1979
## Language: Russian/–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π
## Director: Andrey Tarkovsky

In an unnamed country at an unspecified time, there is a fiercely protected post-apocalyptic wasteland known as The Zone.
An illegal guide (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), whose mutant child suggests unspeakable horrors within The Zone, leads a writer (Anatoliy Solonitsyn) and a scientist (Nikolay Grinko) into the heart of the devastation in search of a mythical place known only as The Room. Anyone who enters The Room will supposedly have any of his earthly desires immediately fulfilled.

Tarkovsky is known for making retrospective and meaningful movies, and while I haven't seen all of his works, Stalker was my favorite for its question on the purpose of life and the existentialist thought of why we suffer.
Stalker faced some difficulties during the production of the film, since it had to be recorded twice because the first batch of film was ruined during the development process, making most of the footage unusable.
There were many rumors surrounding the film, saying it was the reason the actors and Tarkovsky himself died several years later from medical issues, because in several scenes, the crew were traversing into very dirty and unkempt environments, with one of the actors swimming through murky and obviously polluted still-water.

The movie is available to watch for free on youtube, with subtitles! I really love that movie, and I would appreciate it if more people knew about it, even though it's not really underrated hehe. It's considered a Soviet classic. You can watch it [here](https://youtu.be/Q3hBLv-HLEc?si=tDoCQceTckC4MysD).
